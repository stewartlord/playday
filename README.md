This sample code makes use of Materialize, jQuery and Player.js to implement a HTML5 video player with a playlist. The player gets it's data from a RESTful web-service that exposes media items and embed codes. The video itself is served via Akamai's content delivery network.

For bonus points, there are automated tests written with CasperJS running against PhantomJS. There is also an easter egg (hidden feature) tucked away in the bottom right corner.
